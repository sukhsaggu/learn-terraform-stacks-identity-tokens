# terraform-stacks-identity-tokens

This repository contains Terraform configurations that demonstrate how to configure Cloud providers for use with Terraform Stacks.

Within Stacks, users can define `identity_token` blocks. 
These blocks generate a [JWT](https://jwt.io/) that can then be exchanged with cloud providers via OAuth / OIDC. 
This provides a more secure authentication and authorization approach than traditional approaches (such as an AWS id and token pair).

In order for these tokens to be valid, you must first configure your target cloud provider so that it trusts JWTs generated by HCP Terraform.
This repository contains example Terraform configurations for configuring trust and permissions between HCP, AWS, and GCP accounts and Terraform Stacks.
